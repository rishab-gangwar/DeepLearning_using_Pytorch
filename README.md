# DeepLearning_using_Pytorch
used a pretrained Model(VGG 16) from torchvision's model zoo <br>the occlusion analysis was done on few images from imagenet challenge<br> 
done occlusion analysis by using occluded block of specified size and pixel by moving it accross the image,<br>thus calculating change in probability
